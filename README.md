**Project Overview: Job Application Management Plugin**

**Objective:**
Develop a JavaScript-based browser plugin designed to streamline and organize the job application process. This tool will facilitate easy data entry, tracking, and analysis of job applications.

**Core Features:**

1. **Data Entry Interface:**
   - Customizable fields including job position name, application link, referral source, sponsorship availability, follow-up requirement, and application date.
   - The application date should auto-populate with the current date.
   - Easy copy-paste functionality from the browser to the plugin's text boxes.

2. **Integration with Local Database:**
   - Synchronize data with a local database (initially planned for Google Sheets integration).
   - Each field in the plugin corresponds to a column in the database, with each job application represented as a row.

3. **Job Application Tracking:**
   - Monitor application statuses, including follow-ups.
   - Automated reminders for applications marked for follow-up.

4. **Resume Upload and Analysis:**
   - Capability to upload a resume.
   - An algorithm to compare the resume with job descriptions, providing a compatibility score based on keyword matching.

5. **Automated Date Recording:**
   - The date of application should be automatically captured and recorded when a new entry is made.

**Suggested Enhancements:**

1. **Customizable Dashboard:**
   - A user-friendly dashboard showing an overview of applications, including statuses, upcoming follow-ups, and a summary of match scores.

2. **Alerts and Notifications:**
   - Browser notifications for upcoming follow-ups or deadlines.
   - Optional email notifications for critical reminders.

3. **Data Visualization Tools:**
   - Graphs and charts to visualize application statuses, success rates, and other relevant metrics.

4. **Export Functionality:**
   - Option to export data to various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for backup or offline analysis.

5. **User Preferences and Settings:**
   - Allow users to customize fields, notification settings, and data display options.

6. **Security Features:**
   - Ensure data privacy and security, especially for personal information contained in resumes and application details.

7. **Mobile Compatibility:**
   - Make the plugin responsive and compatible with mobile browsers for on-the-go access.

8. **Integration with Job Portals:**
   - Option to directly import job details from popular job portals to reduce manual data entry.

9. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Incorporate a feature for users to provide feedback on the plugin for continuous improvement.

10. **AI-Enhanced Job Matching:**
    - Implement AI algorithms for more sophisticated matching between job requirements and resume content.
